# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview PyBer_Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to create a summary DataFrame of ride-sharing data by city type of rural, suburban and urban.
Using Pandas and Matplotlib, a multiple-line graph will be generated to show total weekly fares by each city type.

The deliverables for this analysis include:
  *  A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
  *  A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type
  *  Business recommendations for addressing any disparities among the city types

### District Summary

Below is the summary DataFrame of the ride data detailing total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fares per ride and average
fare per driver.

This data shows that the majority of drivers and total rides occurs in the urban city type.  Total rides in the urban city type is almost 70% 
compared to 25% for suburban and 5% for rural.  Total fares are the lowest in the rural area however the average fare per ride and
average fare per driver is the highest in the rural area.  



## PyBer_Analysis Summary

Three business recommendations to address disparities among the city types:

* The average fare per driver is much higher for rural vs urban drivers.  More research should be completed to review
  total time and distances of the rides for rural vs. urban to determine if there is an opportunity to raise fares
  in the urban city type.
* Further analysis should be completed to determine if there is missed opportunities or more demand than being met
  in the rural areas.  If so, develop incentives to attract more drivers to meet demand.
* The suburban total fares start to trend upward towards the end of April while the urban and rural areas decline
  or flatten out.  Expand the analysis to determine if there is seasonality in volumes and review annual ride 
  fares and driver fares by city type.
